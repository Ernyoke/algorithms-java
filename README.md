# algorithms-java

This project contains the implementation of several algorithms done for educational purpose.

## Algorithms

* Collections:
    * Sorting:
        * Quicksort
        * Insertions sort
        * Counting sort
        * Heap sort
        * Merge sort
    * Misc:
        * List partitioning
        * Kadane's algorithm (Maximum sum of contiguous subarray)
        * Kth most frequent element
        * Running sum
        + Recursive reduction
    * Search:
        * Quick select
        * Linear search
        * Binary search
    * Single Linked List:
        * Reverse (in place)
* Matrices:
    * Square of zeroes
* Backtracking:
    * N-Queens
* Mathematical:
    * IsPrime
    * First N prime
    * Nth prime
    * Primes less than N (using sieve of Eratosthenes)
* Strings:
    * IsPalindrome
    * Knuth-Morris-Pratt substring match
    * Character histogram
    * IsAnagram
    * Group anagrams
* Dynamic Programming:
    * Rod cutting problem
    * Water area
