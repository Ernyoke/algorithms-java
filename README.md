    * Sorting:
        * Quicksort
        * Insertions sort
        * Counting sort
        * Heap sort
        * Merge sort
    * Misc
        * List partitioning
        * Kadane's algorithm (Maximum sum of contiguous subarray)
        * Kth most frequent element
        * Running sum
    * Search
        * Quick select
        * Linear search
* Backtracking:
    * N-Queens
* Mathematical:
    * IsPrime
    * First N prime
    * Nth prime
    * Primes less than N (using sieve of Eratosthenes)
* Strings:
    * IsPalindrome
* Dynamic Programming:
    * Rod cutting problem
